# winlab-skidsteer-control
Scripts for controlling skidsteer car. The arduino script is for the car, and the Python script is for the RPi (or computer connected over SSH). The Python script requires curses and serial, and the Arduino script requires the Adafruit motor shield library.
NOTE:
Getting the serial library installed and working is kinda weird as PySerial and serial are different and like to conflict.
